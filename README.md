# data_structures
This repository will hold examples of classic data structures implemented by Python.

#Stack:
Demonstrates a stack that utilizes a constructor, that optionally accepts an iterable of values, and produces a stack using those values. This is done without using built-in python lists, tuples, or dictionaries, nor any of the native implementations of stack/queue/deque from the queue python standard library.

#DLL
The first and last nodes of a dll are immediately accessible allowing traversal of the list from the beginning or end of the list. Also any node of a doubly linked list can be used to begin a new traversal of the list, in either direction (beginning or end), from the given node.
