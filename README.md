# data_structures
This repository will hold examples of classic data structures implemented by Python.

#Stack:
Demonstrates a stack that utilizes a constructor, that optionally accepts an iterable of values, and produces a stack using those values. This is done without using built-in python lists, tuples, or dictionaries, nor any of the native implementations of stack/queue/deque from the queue python standard library.

#Deque:
Implement a deque data structure using python. We are able to append to both the head and tail, and can only pop from the head or tail. Deques have limited access and are in sequential order.
