# DATA STRUCTURES
This repository will hold examples of classic data structures implemented by Python.

#Graph:
A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. We have the methods: add_node, add_edge, del_edge, del_node, neighbors, adjacent, nodes, and edges.

#Stack:
Demonstrates a stack that utilizes a constructor, that optionally accepts an iterable of values, and produces a stack using those values. This is done without using built-in python lists, tuples, or dictionaries, nor any of the native implementations of stack/queue/deque from the queue python standard library.

#Deque:
Implement a deque data structure using python. We are able to append to both the head and tail, and can only pop from the head or tail. Deques have limited access and are in sequential order.
