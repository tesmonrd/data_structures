#Stack:
Demonstrates a stack that utilizes a constructor, that optionally accepts an iterable of values, and produces a stack using those values. This is done without using built-in python lists, tuples, or dictionaries, nor any of the native implementations of stack/queue/deque from the queue python standard library.
