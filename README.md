# Proper Parenthetics Challenge

This branch contains a Python funtion that will take a unicode string and see if the correct number of parentheses are present in the string, as well as seeing if the parentheses are in the correct order. 

It will return:
```
-1 : if there are too many closing parentheses and if the code is broken
 0 : if there are the correct amount of parentheses
 1 : if there are too many open parentheses 
```
